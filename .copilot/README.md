## Project Overview
- **Type**: Android/Kotlin application
- **Framework**: Jetpack Compose

- **Target Audience**: Turkish preschool children (ages 3-6)
- **Purpose**: Educational brain game with cognitive skill development

## Key Technologies

- Material Design 3
- Android SDK 24+ (minSdk 24)
- ViewModel for state management
- Compose Navigation
- Text-to-Speech API (Turkish)

## Code Style Guidelines
1. Use Turkish comments for educational content
2. Follow Material Design 3 guidelines for UI
3. Use ViewModel for state management
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Use descriptive variable names in Turkish for game content
6. Follow Android best practices for resource management

## Special Considerations
